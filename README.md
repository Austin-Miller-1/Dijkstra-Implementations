# Dijkstra-Implementations
This repository contains the final project for my Data Structures class. 
This was completed between myself and Dan Kostecki. 

It contains 4 different implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm, as well 
as a report on what Dijkstra's algorithm is, how the different implementations 
differ in effectiveness and data on the differences in effectiveness for an example 
problem.

 Currently, the old files are the only ones to exist. However, a remake of this 
 project is planned.
